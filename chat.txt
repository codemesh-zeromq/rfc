Chat application protocol (CAP)

CAP applications have two threads:
- Network listener
- UI thread

CAP application port is 7315.

The network listener will use a SUB socket to CONNECT to everyone in the
network on CAP application port and SUBSCRIBE to every message. CAP
network thread will print received messages to standard output. CAP
applications subscribe to the empty string, receiving all messages on
the network.

The UI thread will use a PUB socket to BIND to the local interface on
CAP application port. Text received from standard input will be
sent to the UI threads PUB socket.

Character set is UTF-8

Messages should be prefixed with the nick name of the sending user
enclosed in angle brackets:

  <foo> Hello

Messages should not include any trailing newlines.
